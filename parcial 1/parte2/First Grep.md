#grep
#### Description

Can you find the flag in [file](https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/static/515f19f3612bfd97cd3f0c0ba32bd864/file)? This would be really tedious to look through manually, something tells me there is a better way.

### Solution

```shell
──(kali㉿kali)-[~/Downloads]
└─$ grep picoCTF file                                                                                  
picoCTF{grep_is_good_to_find_things_5af9d829}

```

### Flag
picoCTF{grep_is_good_to_find_things_5af9d829}
